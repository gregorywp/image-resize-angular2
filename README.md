This is the main angular app for the image resizer here: http://dev.gregoryprill.com/resize/

This is built off of the angular quickstart seed. The purpose is to explore a way to accept an image upload and then display it at any given size with that image actually being exactly that size. To acheive this we use an uploader node app and a resizer node app.

Works with my node-upload and node-resize repos.
